My name is 萧尧 (xiāo yáo). I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in **Computational Science and Engineering** at [Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences](https://seas.harvard.edu/) (2024-). Before that I obtained my Bachelor's degree in **Honors Mathematics** and **Computer Science** at [NYU Shanghai](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/) (2020-2024).

My research interests are mainly in networks and systems. I am also actively involved in open source software development, currently being a core developer of [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/). More details can be found under the [projects page](/projects/). If you want to contact me, you may reach me at [yaoxiao@g.harvard.edu](mailto:yaoxiao@g.harvard.edu) or [yx2436@nyu.edu](mailto:yx2436@yx2436.edu).
