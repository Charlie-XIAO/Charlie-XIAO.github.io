To get a development environment, first make sure that you have the [Firefox browser](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) installed. Then clone our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ossd-s23/YouTube-Customizer) to your local device and visit the Mozilla Firefox debugging page `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox` in the Firefox browser. Click the *Load Temporary Add-on...* button and select `src/manifest.json`. Then you will be able to simulate an environment with this extension until you exit the browser.

There is also a self-distributed version available [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4069744/438bf7e9f2714ba58ac1-1.0.xpi). Make sure you have a [Mozilla developer account](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/), and you are using the Firefox browser so as to use this link.
