\begin{itemize}[nosep]
  \item Proved that in $\mathbb{Z}^d$, infinite cluster density at critical point $\mathbf{P}_{\infty}(p_c)=0$ if and only if invasion probability $G_{\mathbb{Z}^d}(0,x)\rightarrow0$ as $|x|\rightarrow\infty$.
  \item Verified via simulation that $G_{\mathbb{Z}^3}(0,x)\leq G_{\mathbb{Z}^2}(0,x)$ for each $|x|$, thus proving that $\mathbf{P}_{\infty}(p_c)=0$ in $\mathbb{Z}^3$ given the fact that it holds in $\mathbb{Z}^2$.
  \item Estimated the fractal dimension of the invasion percolation cluster in $\mathbb{Z}^3$ numerically which was approximately $2.627$.
\end{itemize}
