\begin{itemize}[nosep]
  \item Designed t-SGNE specialized for graphs, leveraging the neighboring relations between nodes and achieving 6.7x computation efficiency.
  \item Proposed SPLEE, a graph embedding method based on Laplacian eigenmaps and shortest paths, intended to suit t-SGNE. 
  \item Combined SPLEE and t-SGNE for visualization of graphs with 300K nodes and 1M edges, achieving 10\% improvement in visual effect.
\end{itemize}
