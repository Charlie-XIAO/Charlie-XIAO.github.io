\begin{itemize}[nosep]
  \item Proposed the ConfMask framework to systematically anonymize topology and routing information in network configurations.
  \item Designed the anonymization algorithm for different protocols that mitigated deanonymization risks yet preserved important utilities.
  \item Managed to rigorously prove the route equivalence and routing utility preservation properties of the anonymization framework.
  \item Led the implementation of the end-to-end network configuration anonymization system and the artifact evaluation.
\end{itemize}
