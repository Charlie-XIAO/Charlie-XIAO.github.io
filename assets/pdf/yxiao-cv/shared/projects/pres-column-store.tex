\skills{C, SIMD/AVX, multi-threading, query optimizations}

\begin{itemize}[nosep]
  \item Built a cache-conscious column store that supports CRUD and schema operations, indexing, and joins, optimized for select queries.
  \item Supported clustered / unclustered sorted / B+ tree indexes, achieving 5x select speedup with <5\% bulk loading overhead on 100M data.
  \item Implemented cache-conscious sort-merge and hash joins parallelized across all cores, outperforming nested-loop joins by up to 10x.
  \item Optimized with cache-conscious batching, multi-threading, and vectorized processing (AVX), speeding up 4x loading and 6x select.
\end{itemize}
