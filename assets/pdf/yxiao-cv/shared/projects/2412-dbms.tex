\skills{C, SIMD/AVX, database optimizations, cache-conscious algorithms}

\begin{itemize}[nosep]
  \item Streamlined CSV parsing and cache-aware chunked loading, achieving >4x speedup over naive row-wise loading on 400M data.
  \item Implemented shared scan for batchable queries with parallelization, achieving >20x speedup for 100M data and 100 queries.
  \item Supported B+ tree indexes, with <20ms bulk loading overhead and >25x select query speedup over 100M data with 5\% selectivity.
  \item Optimized and parallelized radix hash join, outperforming naive hash join by >15x when joining 100M$\times$100M data.
\end{itemize}
