\begin{itemize}[nosep]
  \item Modeled gyroscopes as networks of springs, formulated the system with differential equations, and solved it via Euler's method.
  \item Simulated vertical stacks of gyroscopes, and found that they obeyed gyroscopic precession assuming a flexible middle axle.
\end{itemize}
