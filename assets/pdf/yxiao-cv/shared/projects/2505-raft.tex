\datedsubsection{\textbf{Distributed Fault-Tolerant KV Store Using Raft} | Course Project | \href{https://github.com/Charlie-XIAO/raft-kv}{GitHub}}{2025.02 -- 2025.05}

\skills{Go, C++, Rust, RPC, distributed systems, consensus algorithms, fault tolerance, database sharding}

\begin{itemize}[nosep]
  \item Built a sharded, fault-tolerant KV store that guarantees strong consistency and high availability using the Raft consensus algorithm.
  \item Implemented leader election, log replication, state machine updates, and snapshotting to tolerate node failures and network partitions.
  \item Delivered E2E implementations in Go, C++, and Rust, exposing identical APIs with consistent behavior, performance, and resilience.
  \item Achieved high throughput under strong consistency, sustaining >600/>100 ops/s under reliable/unreliable networks with 10 clients.
\end{itemize}
