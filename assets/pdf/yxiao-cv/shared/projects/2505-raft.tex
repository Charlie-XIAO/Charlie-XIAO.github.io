\datedsubsection{\textbf{Fault-Tolerant Key-Value Store Using Raft} | Course Project}{2025.02 -- 2025.05}

\skills{Go, RPC, distributed systems, consensus algorithms, fault tolerance}

\begin{itemize}[nosep]
  \item Developed a distributed key-value store in Go, backed by the Raft consensus algorithm for strong consistency.
  \item Implemented leader election, log replication, and state machine updates to tolerate node failures and network partitions.
  \item Utilized goroutines and channels for concurrent and efficient I/O operations, RPC communication, and fault-tolerance mechanisms.
  \item Validated the design under MIT 6.5840 test suite, ensuring correctness, reliability, and high performance under various failure scenarios.
\end{itemize}
