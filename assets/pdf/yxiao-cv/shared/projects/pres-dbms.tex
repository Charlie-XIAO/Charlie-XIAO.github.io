\skills{C/C++, SIMD/AVX, OpenMP, MPI, database sharding, cache-conscious algorithms}

\begin{itemize}[nosep]
  \item Parallelized and vectorized complex select queries with OpenMP and SIMD, achieving >20x speedup on 100M data with 100 predicates.
  \item Supported B+ tree column index, with <20ms bulk loading overhead and >25x select query speedup over 100M data with 5\% selectivity.
  \item Embarrassingly parallelized radix hash join, outperforming naive hash join by >15x when joining 100M$\times$100M data.
  \item Implemented database sharding with MPI for distributed processing over multiple nodes, achieving near-linear speedup and scalability.
\end{itemize}
