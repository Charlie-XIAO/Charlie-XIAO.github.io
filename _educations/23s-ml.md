## Assignments

Unfortunately, the Spring 2023 semester of this course does not involve any project. However, the assignments are more or less like small projects and my own versions can be seen [here](/assets/pdf/educations/23s-ml-assignments.pdf), with codes embedded as text. Note however, that the solutions are not guaranteed to be correct and are only for reference.
