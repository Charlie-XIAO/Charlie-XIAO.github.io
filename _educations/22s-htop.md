## Projects

In a group of three, we investigated the application of Stochastic Calculus in Economics, specifically the derivation of Black-Scholes-Merton equation. You may access our presentation slides [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eExumARqI2gnmWAmaOGR-H7rrgqHTWSm/view?usp=sharing). It was mainly focused on three parts: Brownian motion, stochastic calculus, and risk-neutral pricing (including the derivation of Black-Scholes-Merton equation). Our final report is titled [Black-Scholes-Merton Equation and Risk-Neutral Pricing](/assets/pdf/educations/22s-htop-report.pdf).
