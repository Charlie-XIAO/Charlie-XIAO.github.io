The invasion percolation process is widely known related to the standard Bernoulli bond percolation model. It is known that the finite cluster density $$ \mathbb{P}_{\infty}(p_c)=0 $$ at critical point for Bernoulli bond percolation in $$ \mathbb{Z}^2 $$, but this conclusion is not yet proven to extend to higher dimensions. We note that it is easy to show the equivalence between $$ \mathbb{P}_{\infty}(p*c)=0 $$ in $$ \mathbb{Z}^d $$ and $$ G*{\mathbb{Z}^d}(0,x)\to0 $$ as $$ \lvert x\rvert\to\infty $$ for the invasion percolation process, where $$ G*{\mathbb{Z}^d}(0,x) $$ is the probability that $$ x $$ is invaded by an invasion percolation process starting from the origin. In this paper, we will then show by simulation the dominance of $$ G*{\mathbb{Z}^3}(0,x) $$ by $$ G*{\mathbb{Z}^2}(0,x) $$ for the same $$ \lvert x\rvert $$, based on which we show that $$ \mathbb{P}*{\infty}(p_c)=0 $$ in $$ \mathbb{Z}^3 $$. Finally we will numerically estimate the fractal dimension of invasion percolation cluster in $$ \mathbb{Z}^3 $$.
