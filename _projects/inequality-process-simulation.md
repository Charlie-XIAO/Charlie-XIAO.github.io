## Overview

In this project, we simulate the inequality process via random transactions with certain transaction functions and restrictions within a population, trying to observe the pattern of the distribution of wealth across the society.

## Results

You may access our GitHub source code [here](https://github.com/Charlie-XIAO/Econ-simulation). The demonstration of animations of histograms and distribution fitting in our simulation can be found on this [demo page](https://charlie-xiao.github.io/Econ-simulation/demo/). Our presentation slides can be found [here](https://github.com/Charlie-XIAO/Econ-simulation/blob/master/Paper/Inequality_Process_Simulation__Final_Presentation__Modeling_and_Simulation__Fall_2022_.pdf). Our technical report is titled [Inequality Process Simulation](/assets/pdf/projects/inequality-process-simulation.pdf).

## Conclusions

With a real-world economy simulation, we find that the distribution of wealth fits the gamma distribution and the beta prime distribution, agreeing with the research results on real-world economic systems. Moreover, by adjusting the bias towards the richer party, the layers of the society, and the tax policy, we find that a higher bias towards the rich leads to much inequality. Also, the more layers, the more equal the wealth distribution. Finally, a reasonable tax policy can also lead to less inequality.
