We propose LawLLM, an LLM-powered intelligent legal system featuring on (1) Versatile Services: LawLLM provides a versatile diverse range of services through its multi-task capabilities; (2) Legal Reasoning: It is fine-tuned on supervised instruction data curated with legal syllogism prompting, enabling LawLLM to develop stronger legal reasoning capabilities based on clear judicial logics; (3) Verifiable Retrieval: with verifiable labels, LawLLM can first distinguish relevant external knowledge, then incorporate and finally validate it, enhancing the quality and actuality of model output. A comprehensive legal benchmark, Law-Eval, is further constructed to evaluate intelligent legal systems from both objective and subjective dimensions. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our system in serving various users across diverse legal scenarios.
