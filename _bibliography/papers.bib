  abstract={
    Real-world network configurations play a critical role in network management and
    research tasks. While valuable, data holders of ten hesitate to share them due to
    business and privacy concerns. Existing methods are deficient in concealing the
    implicit information that can be inferred from configurations, such as topology and
    routing paths. To address this, we present ConfMask, a novel framework designed to
    systematically anonymize network topology and routing paths in configurations. Our
    approach tackles key privacy, utility, and scalability challenges, which arise from
    the strong dependency between different datasets and complex routing protocols. Our
    anonymization algorithm is scalable to large networks and effectively mitigates
    de-anonymization risk. Moreover, it maintains essential network properties such as
    reachability, waypointing and multi-path consistency, making it suitable for a wide
    range of downstream tasks. Compared to existing dataplane anonymization algorithm
    (i.e., NetHide), ConfMask reduces ~75% specification differences between the
    original and the anonymized networks.

  title={LawLLM: Intelligent Legal System with Legal Reasoning and Verifiable Retrieval},
  booktitle={The 29th International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications (DASFAA'24)},
  year={2024},
  abstract={
    We propose LawLLM, an LLM-powered intelligent legal system featuring on (1)
    Versatile Services: LawLLM provides a versatile diverse range of services through
    its multi-task capabilities; (2) Legal Reasoning: It is fine-tuned on supervised
    instruction data curated with legal syllogism prompting, enabling LawLLM to develop
    stronger legal reasoning capabilities based on clear judicial logics; (3) Verifiable
    Retrieval: with verifiable Labels, LawLLM can first distinguish relevant external
    knowledge, then incorporate and finally validate it, enhancing the quality and
    actuality of model output. A comprehensive legal benchmark, Law-Eval, is further
    constructed to evaluate intelligent legal systems from both objective and subjective
    dimensions. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our system in serving
    various users across diverse legal scenarios.

  title={Efficiently Visualizing Large Graphs},
  year={2023},
  abstract={
    Most existing graph visualization methods based on dimension reduction are limited
    to relatively small graphs due to performance issues. In this work, we propose a
    novel dimension reduction method for graph visualization, called t-Distributed
    Stochastic Graph Neighbor Embedding (t-SGNE). t-SGNE is specifically designed to
    visualize cluster structures in the graph. As a variant of the standard t-SNE
    method, t-SGNE avoids the time-consuming computations of pairwise similarity.
    Instead, it uses the neighbor structures of the graph to reduce the time complexity
    from quadratic to linear, thus supporting larger graphs. In addition, to suit
    t-SGNE, we combined Laplacian Eigenmaps with the shortest path algorithm in graphs
    to form the graph embedding algorithm ShortestPath Laplacian Eigenmaps Embedding
    (SPLEE). Performing SPLEE to obtain a high-dimensional embedding of the large-scale
    graph and then using t-SGNE to reduce its dimension for visualization, we are able
    to visualize graphs with up to 300K nodes and 1M edges within 5 minutes and achieve
    approximately 10% improvement in visualization quality. Codes and data are available
